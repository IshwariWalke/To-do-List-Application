To-Do List Application

Overview:

This project is a simple To-Do List Application implemented in C++. The application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing features such as adding tasks, removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing all tasks.

Key Features:

Add a Task: Users can add new tasks with a title.
Remove a Task: Users can remove tasks by specifying the task index.
Mark a Task as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed based on the task index.
Display All Tasks: Users can view a list of all tasks along with their status (completed or not).

The program runs via a menu-driven interface where the user can select operations to perform on their to-do list.
How the Application Works

Adding a Task:
When a user adds a task, they provide a task title. The new task is added to the list with a default status of "Not Completed."
Removing a Task:
The user can remove any task from the list by providing the index number of the task. Once removed, the task is no longer available in the list.
Marking a Task as Completed:
Users can mark a task as completed by providing the corresponding task index. The task's status is updated to "Completed."

Displaying All Tasks:
This option shows all tasks in the list along with their completion status. Users can view tasks in order of creation.
